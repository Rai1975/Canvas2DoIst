# CANVAS2DOIST 

This is a work in progress.

##### CURRENT TODO: 
- Make course decisions more user friendly & potentially some UI elements : WIP, Simple UI to select desired and undesired courses.
- Make environment better accessible : Unfortunately, I cannot create OAuth for Canvas without having admin access.
- Add bash and zsh scripts too.

Here's a fun little script that's just for you if you use Todoist to keep track of your assignments from Canvas! It uses Canvas API and Todoist API to sync your assignments from canvas into todoist.

#### How to Run
1. Once you pull in the repository, change the environment variables within the `.env` file. 
##### Canvas API
To obtain Canvas API, navigate to your account settings and scroll over to 'Approved Integrations'. Click on 'New Access Token' to generate your canvas API key, and insert it into the `.env` file under `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`.
##### Todoist API
Open your todoist app, and click on your profile on the top left and navigate to settings. Within settings, click on 'Integrations'. Click on the tab titled 'Developer' and copy the API token. Insert this key into the `.env` file under `TODOIST_API_TOKEN`.
##### Canvas Base URL
Navigate to your university's canvas landing page, it will usually be of the structure `university.instructure.com`. For example, at the University of Cincinnati, it is `uc.instructure.com`. Find this base URL and insert it into the `.env` under `CANVAS_BASE_URL`.

2. Once you have all the keys inserted into the `.env` file, run the python script.
3. Now, in your browser, navigate to `localhost:5000/sync-assignments`.
4. Voila! Watch your tasks flow into todoist.

##### Powershell Automation
Now if you want to go crazy and set up the powershell script to automate the script with an alias,

1. Open powershell
2. Enter `notepad $profile`
3. Paste the code from `powershell_profile.ps1` into your `$profile`
4. Boom! Now source your profile by running `. $profile` and you're all set! 

This is a jank solution to a problem I've been facing lately to solve my eternal laziness to fill in my todoist myself. This can and will be improved to have a better user experience, but I wanted to put this out there for anyone else facing the same issue.
